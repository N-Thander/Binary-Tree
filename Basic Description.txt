Inorder Traversal:
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the root
3. Traverse the right subtree

Uses -> in case of binary search tree (BST) - inorder traversal gives nodes in non-dereasing order.
        To get nodes of BST in non-increasing order, a variation of "Inorder traversal" where Inorder traversal is reversed can be used.

Preorder Traversal:
1. Visit the root
2. Traverse the left subtree
3. Traverse the right subtree

Uses -> Preorder Traversal is used to create a copy of the tree. 
        It is also used to get the prefix expression on an expression tree.

Postorder Traversal:
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Traverse the right subtree
3. Visit the root

Uses -> It is useful to get the postfix expression of an expression of an expression tree
